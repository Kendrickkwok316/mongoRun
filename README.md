<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Back Story

![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]

# I am the man who will become the Messenger King! 
In 13th centry, Genghis Khan established the largest kingdom the world has ever seen, the Mongol Empire. To rule this vast empire, a well-established stage station system was built to deliver messages and orders to every corner of the kingdom efficiently.

**As one of the best messenger in the army, it is your duty to deliver messages swiftly.**

Travel in the Mongol Empire was never an easy task. You must go through endless rounds of hurdles and even face the challenges from the nature.

## Gameplay

### Obstacle

Dangers spread through your trip across the empire. They can be the hurdles on the ground or birds flying in the sky. They may look harmless to you but trust me, they are <b>NOT</b>.

![Obstacles Screen Shot][obstacle-screenshot]

### Move

During your journey, you can switch between three lanes using up arrow key <kbd>&#8593;</kbd> and down arrow key <kbd>&#8595;</kbd> to avoid hitting those obstacles.

![Move Screen Shot][move-screenshot]

To overcome the challenge posed by hurdles, you can also do what most skilled riders will do - simply jump over them by hitting the <kbd>Space</kbd> key.

![Jump Screen Shot][jump-screenshot]

### Attack

As a highly-skilled Mongolian warrior, <b>Horseback Archery</b> is one of the mighty weapon in your arsenal. Hitting the right arrow key <kbd>&#8594;</kbd>, you can use your trusted bow and arrow to shoot down those birds and clear the sky.

![Attack Screen Shot][attack-screenshot]

### Gerege

To gallop cross the empire freely, you will need <b>Gerege</b> for authentication. If you bump into any obstacle, you may pay a heavy price.

![Damage Screen Shot][damage-screenshot]

But don't worry, sometimes those collectors in the sky will keep some Gerege for themselves and you can earn extra Gerege from them.

![Reward Screen Shot][reward-screenshot]
